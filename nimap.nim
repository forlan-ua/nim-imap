  ##
  ##   Result:     OK - IDLE completed after client sent "DONE"
  ##               NO - failure: the server will not allow the IDLE
  ##                    command at this time
  ##              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid
  ##
  ##   The IDLE command may be used with any IMAP4 server implementation
  ##   that returns "IDLE" as one of the supported capabilities to the
  ##   CAPABILITY command.  If the server does not advertise the IDLE
  ##   capability, the client MUST NOT use the IDLE command and must poll
  ##   for mailbox updates.  In particular, the client MUST continue to be
  ##   able to accept unsolicited untagged responses to ANY command, as
  ##   specified in the base IMAP specification.
  ##
  ##   The IDLE command is sent from the client to the server when the
  ##   client is ready to accept unsolicited mailbox update messages.  The
  ##   server requests a response to the IDLE command using the continuation
  ##   ("+") response.  The IDLE command remains active until the client
  ##   responds to the continuation, and as long as an IDLE command is
  ##   active, the server is now free to send untagged EXISTS, EXPUNGE, and
  ##   other messages at any time.
  ##
  ##   The IDLE command is terminated by the receipt of a "DONE"
  ##   continuation from the client; such response satisfies the server's
  ##   continuation request.  At that point, the server MAY send any
  ##   remaining queued untagged responses and then MUST immediately send
  ##   the tagged response to the IDLE command and prepare to process other
  ##   commands. As in the base specification, the processing of any new
  ##   command may cause the sending of unsolicited untagged responses,
  ##   subject to the ambiguity limitations.  The client MUST NOT send a
  ##   command while the server is waiting for the DONE, since the server
  ##   will not be able to distinguish a command from a continuation.
  ##
  ##   The server MAY consider a client inactive if it has an IDLE command
  ##   running, and if such a server has an inactivity timeout it MAY log
  ##   the client off implicitly at the end of its timeout period.  Because
  ##   of that, clients using IDLE are advised to terminate the IDLE and
  ##   re-issue it at least every 29 minutes to avoid being logged off.
  ##   This still allows a client to receive immediate mailbox updates even

    ## 6.2.2.  AUTHENTICATE Command
    ##
    ## The AUTHENTICATE command indicates a [SASL] authentication
    ## mechanism to the server.  If the server supports the requested
    ## authentication mechanism, it performs an authentication protocol
    ## exchange to authenticate and identify the client.  It MAY also
    ## negotiate an OPTIONAL security layer for subsequent protocol
    ## interactions.  If the requested authentication mechanism is not
    ## supported, the server SHOULD reject the AUTHENTICATE command by
    ## sending a tagged NO response.
    ##
    ## The AUTHENTICATE command does not support the optional "initial
    ## response" feature of [SASL].  Section 5.1 of [SASL] specifies how
    ## to handle an authentication mechanism which uses an initial
    ## response.
    ##
    ## The service name specified by this protocol's profile of [SASL] is
    ## "imap".
    ##
    ## The authentication protocol exchange consists of a series of
    ## server challenges and client responses that are specific to the
    ## authentication mechanism.  A server challenge consists of a
    ## command continuation request response with the "+" token followed
    ## by a BASE64 encoded string.  The client response consists of a
    ## single line consisting of a BASE64 encoded string.  If the client
    ## wishes to cancel an authentication exchange, it issues a line
    ## consisting of a single "*".  If the server receives such a
    ## response, it MUST reject the AUTHENTICATE command by sending a
    ## tagged BAD response.
    ##
    ## If a security layer is negotiated through the [SASL]
    ## authentication exchange, it takes effect immediately following the
    ## CRLF that concludes the authentication exchange for the client,
    ## and the CRLF of the tagged OK response for the server.
    ##
    ## While client and server implementations MUST implement the
    ## AUTHENTICATE command itself, it is not required to implement any
    ## authentication mechanisms other than the PLAIN mechanism described
    ## in [IMAP-TLS].  Also, an authentication mechanism is not required
    ## to support any security layers.
    ##
    ##     Note: a server implementation MUST implement a
    ##     configuration in which it does NOT permit any plaintext
    ##     password mechanisms, unless either the STARTTLS command
    ##     has been negotiated or some other mechanism that
    ##     protects the session from password snooping has been
    ##     provided.  Server sites SHOULD NOT use any configuration
    ##     which permits a plaintext password mechanism without
    ##     such a protection mechanism against password snooping.
    ##     Client and server implementations SHOULD implement
    ##     additional [SASL] mechanisms that do not use plaintext
    ##     passwords, such the GSSAPI mechanism described in [SASL]
    ##     and/or the [DIGEST-MD5] mechanism.
    ##
    ## Servers and clients can support multiple authentication
    ## mechanisms.  The server SHOULD list its supported authentication
    ## mechanisms in the response to the CAPABILITY command so that the
    ## client knows which authentication mechanisms to use.
    ##
    ## A server MAY include a CAPABILITY response code in the tagged OK
    ## response of a successful AUTHENTICATE command in order to send
    ## capabilities automatically.  It is unnecessary for a client to
    ## send a separate CAPABILITY command if it recognizes these
    ## automatic capabilities.  This should only be done if a security
    ## layer was not negotiated by the AUTHENTICATE command, because the
    ## tagged OK response as part of an AUTHENTICATE command is not
    ## protected by encryption/integrity checking.  [SASL] requires the
    ## client to re-issue a CAPABILITY command in this case.
    ##
    ## If an AUTHENTICATE command fails with a NO response, the client
    ## MAY try another authentication mechanism by issuing another
    ## AUTHENTICATE command.  It MAY also attempt to authenticate by
    ## using the LOGIN command (see section 6.2.3 for more detail).  In
    ## other words, the client MAY request authentication types in
    ## decreasing order of preference, with the LOGIN command as a last
    ## resort.
    ##
    ## The authorization identity passed from the client to the server
    ## during the authentication exchange is interpreted by the server as
    ## the user name whose privileges the client is requesting.

    ## of all names available to the client.  Zero or more untagged LIST
    ## replies are returned, containing the name attributes, hierarchy
    ## delimiter, and name; see the description of the LIST reply for
    ## more detail.
    ##
    ## The LIST command SHOULD return its data quickly, without undue
    ## delay.  For example, it SHOULD NOT go to excess trouble to
    ## calculate the \Marked or \Unmarked status or perform other
    ## processing; if each name requires 1 second of processing, then a
    ## list of 1200 names would take 20 minutes!
    ##
    ## An empty ("" string) reference name argument indicates that the
    ## mailbox name is interpreted as by SELECT.  The returned mailbox
    ## names MUST match the supplied mailbox name pattern.  A non-empty
    ## reference name argument is the name of a mailbox or a level of
    ## mailbox hierarchy, and indicates the context in which the mailbox
    ## name is interpreted.
    ##
    ## An empty ("" string) mailbox name argument is a special request to
    ## return the hierarchy delimiter and the root name of the name given
    ## in the reference.  The value returned as the root MAY be the empty
    ## string if the reference is non-rooted or is an empty string.  In
    ## all cases, a hierarchy delimiter (or NIL if there is no hierarchy)
    ## is returned.  This permits a client to get the hierarchy delimiter
    ## (or find out that the mailbox names are flat) even when no
    ## mailboxes by that name currently exist.
    ##
    ## The reference and mailbox name arguments are interpreted into a
    ## canonical form that represents an unambiguous left-to-right
    ## hierarchy.  The returned mailbox names will be in the interpreted
    ## form.
    ##
    ##     Note: The interpretation of the reference argument is
    ##     implementation-defined.  It depends upon whether the
    ##     server implementation has a concept of the "current
    ##     working directory" and leading "break out characters",
    ##     which override the current working directory.
    ##
    ##     For example, on a server which exports a UNIX or NT
    ##     filesystem, the reference argument contains the current
    ##     working directory, and the mailbox name argument would
    ##     contain the name as interpreted in the current working
    ##     directory.
    ##
    ##     If a server implementation has no concept of break out
    ##     characters, the canonical form is normally the reference
    ##     name appended with the mailbox name.  Note that if the
    ##     server implements the namespace convention (section
    ##     5.1.2), "#" is a break out character and must be treated
    ##     as such.
    ##
    ##     If the reference argument is not a level of mailbox
    ##     hierarchy (that is, it is a \NoInferiors name), and/or
    ##     the reference argument does not end with the hierarchy
    ##     delimiter, it is implementation-dependent how this is
    ##     interpreted.  For example, a reference of "foo/bar" and
    ##     mailbox name of "rag/baz" could be interpreted as
    ##     "foo/bar/rag/baz", "foo/barrag/baz", or "foo/rag/baz".
    ##     A client SHOULD NOT use such a reference argument except
    ##     at the explicit request of the user.  A hierarchical
    ##     browser MUST NOT make any assumptions about server
    ##     interpretation of the reference unless the reference is
    ##     a level of mailbox hierarchy AND ends with the hierarchy
    ##     delimiter.
    ##
    ## Any part of the reference argument that is included in the
    ## interpreted form SHOULD prefix the interpreted form.  It SHOULD
    ## also be in the same form as the reference name argument.  This
    ## rule permits the client to determine if the returned mailbox name
    ## is in the context of the reference argument, or if something about
    ## the mailbox argument overrode the reference argument.  Without
    ## this rule, the client would have to have knowledge of the server's
    ## naming semantics including what characters are "breakouts" that
    ## override a naming context.

    ##
    ## Unlike the LIST command, the STATUS command is not guaranteed to

    ## quite slow.  In some implementations, the server is obliged to
    ## open the mailbox read-only internally to obtain certain status
    ## information.  Also unlike the LIST command, the STATUS command
    ## does not accept wildcards.
    ##
    ##    Note: The STATUS command is intended to access the
    ##    status of mailboxes other than the currently selected
    ##    mailbox.  Because the STATUS command can cause the
    ##    mailbox to be opened internally, and because this
    ##    information is available by other means on the selected

    ##     the message literal argument to APPEND.  The full
    ##     implications of doing so MUST be understood and
    ##     carefully weighed.

    ## If a flag parenthesized list is specified, the flags SHOULD be set
    ## in the resulting message; otherwise, the flag list of the
    ## resulting message is set to empty by default.  In either case, the
    ## Recent flag is also set.
